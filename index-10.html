<li>The address provided for the recipient is incorrect or incomplete;&nbsp;</li>
<li>No one with the recipient&rsquo;s name is present at the address provided; or</li>
<li>There is no contact number or an incorrect or invalid number provided so VIP Flowers has no way to check on delivery details.</li>
<li>If no one is at home at the time of delivery&nbsp;VIP Flowers will make every effort to contact the person ordering flowers or the recipient where we are having difficulty in delivering the flowers.</li>
<li>If an order requires more than one attempt at delivery for any reason, a re-delivery fee may apply and any subsequent amount will be charged to your credit card. &nbsp;Please ensure that all of the contact details provided are correct.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Delivering multiple orders a single address</h3>
<p>To order multiple products for delivery to the same address at the same time, please call 1300 847 356.</p>
<h2><strong>Substitutions</strong></h2>
<h3>Our Policy</h3>
<p>As flowers are a natural product and subject to seasonal and practical availability, it may be necessary for our Florists to make substitutions to flowers, packaging and merchandise in order to deliver orders on time or where flowers or products are temporarily unavailable.</p>
<p>In the case where a specific flower type or colour is unavailable within the given time frame of delivery, substitutions may be made for flowers of a similar shape, size and value. &nbsp;Different flower types and colours may be used if the overall effect of the arrangement is maintained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the event that the substitution constitutes a major departure from the content or style of the advertised product, we will make every effort to reach you by phone and email to seek you approval before proceeding.</p>
<p>All substitutions will be made with appropriate products to the same value or greater than the original order.</p>
<h3>Product Freshness</h3>
<p>We only use the freshest and best quality product at VIP Flowers. As such, some stems, including Lilies, may be closed when received.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Website Pricing</h3>
<p>All prices on the VIP Flowers website are shown in Australian Dollars ($AUD) and are inclusive of GST.</p>
<p>After an order is processed for delivery to a regional area, we reserve the right to vary the price and will seek the customer's consent to continue with the increase, or provide a full refund.</p>
<h3>Promotion Codes</h3>
<p>Only one promotion code may be used per order. This is applicable for orders placed via the website and the call centre. If you need assistance with an existing promotion code please call 1300 847 356&nbsp;before placing your order.</p>
<h3>Payment</h3>
<p>We accept payment by Visa, Mastercard, American Express and Diners Club credit cards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When providing your credit or debit card details you are agreeing that you are authorised to use that card and it must have sufficient available funds to cover your charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
